# USACO (bronze) 2019
Here are my solutions to curated USACO Bronze questions. Feel free to observe how I wrote my code and how you can make yours more efficient.

- I'm going to recreate my solutions and it will hopefully be easy to understand in the .txt file, starting with some random years.
- Lang: C++11 (C++17)
- This repository is for USACO Bronze. **I am not in USACO Bronze anymore so it will not be updated.**

*Some of the solutions do not pass full marks (some are 8/10 or 9/10 test cases).
