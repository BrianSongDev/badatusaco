# badatusaco (bronze) 2019
I'm not that good at USACO so here are my newbie solutions. Feel free to observe how I wrote my code and how you can make yours more efficient.

- I'm going to recreate my solutions and it will hopefully be easy to understand in the .txt file, starting with some random years.
- Lang: C++11 (C++17)
- This repository is for USACO Bronze. **I am not in USACO Bronze anymore so it will not be updated anymore.**

*Some of the solutions do not pass full marks so please don't copy it and try to submit.
