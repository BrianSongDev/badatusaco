I'm bad at USACO so here are my newbie solutions. Feel free to observe how I wrote my code and how you can make yours more efficient.

- I'm going to recreate my solutions and it will hopefully be easy to understand in the .txt file, starting with some random years.
- Lang: C++11 (C++17)
- This repository is for USACO Bronze

*Some of the solutions do not pass full marks so please don't copy it and try to submit.
